## Week 1 | Dart

-   **DAY 1** :

    -   How we can access a piece of dart code from another code file.
-   **DAY 14** :
    -   Explore the dart http package and how to use it to communicate with API's (\* if you don't get this no problem we will use it again so CHILL ðŸ˜„ )

## Week 3 | Flutter

-   **DAY 15** :
    -   The fun begins - Flutter Installation
    -   Run your first flutter app
-   **DAY 16** :
    -   Everything is a Widget
    -   What are Stateless and Stateful Widgets (theory)
-   **DAY 17** :
    -   What is runApp ?
    -   Basic widgets like Scaffold, AppBar, Container, etc.
-   **DAY 18** :
    -   How the hierarchy of flutter widgets work
    -   parent and child Widgets
-   **DAY 19** :

    -   Create your first Hello World.

        Not asking you to be hella create just build a app which has "Hello World" Text positioned at the center of the screen.
        (Now it's totally up to you if you want to tweak it to something cool)

        Hint: Center and Text Widget

-   **DAY 20** :
    -   Lets make it better, now add some Colors to the background of your hello world app
    -   Also add an appBar that says "Hello World App"
-   **DAY 21** :
    -   Some more widgets - Learn about Column and Row Widgets
    -   Use the Column Widget to make an app which says
        Hello
        [Your_name]
        (\* Do this using Column not escape sequence("\n"))

## Week 4 | Flutter

-   **DAY 22** :
    -   How to use the image Widget
    -   pubspec.yaml and its importance
-   **DAY 23** :
    -   Create an app using asset image where the image should be center aligned.
    -   Try the same using network image.
-   **DAY 24** :
    -   Button Widgets and various options available
    -   Create an app where the background color changes using that button.
        Hint: Use a stateful Widget
-   **DAY 25, 26** :

    -   Yayy!! You are almost there

        Now we will be working on the main project i.e(A Dice App)

        Idea -> Create an app where there will be a dice image and a button, when the button is pressed the dice will give some random output.

        Hint -> Use the Random() function for this.

-   **DAY 27, 28** :
    -   Challege: Lets go a step ahead and try to create a dice roller using two dices and with the dices rolling the appBar color should also change.

## What's next?

-   So now you have a very basic understanding of how to build hybrid applications using flutter.

-   Remember whatever applications you created are cross platform and can be compiled in both Android and IOS, even if you want you can create a desktop or web app using the same code.

-   This was a get started with flutter challenge so there's a lot more to learn.
-   So I would suggest to keep learning and working on projects.
-   Learn how to use API's and how to create better UI using Flutter
